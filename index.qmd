This is here primarily so that I can test WebR's functionalities when it comes to delivering a new way to teach CytometryInR. 

To get WebR ready for our purposes...

Navigate to terminal run following

```{bash}
#| eval: FALSE
quarto add coatless/quarto-webr
```

Do you trust author, yes
Embedded webr cells, yes
View documentation, no

Next, change yaml header at top of document to include a filters: webr

And then change the extension on the code block. 

```{webr-r}
A <- 2 + 2
```
